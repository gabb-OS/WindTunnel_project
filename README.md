# 🌬️ Wind Tunnel Project  
**Design and Electronics of a DIY Wind Tunnel for the _Laboratory of Making_ Course - AA.2024-2025**

## 📄 Description  
This project provides instructions to build your own DIY Wind Tunnel — a compact, low-cost tool designed for aerodynamic testing and experimentation. It combines a custom-built physical structure with an electronic control system, including an LCD screen for feedback and smoke visualization for airflow studies.

Whether you're a student, maker, or educator, this wind tunnel offers a great platform to explore fluid dynamics, test model designs, or simply get hands-on with STEM.

## 🛠️ Features  
- ✅ **Adjustable Wind Speed**  
  Control the airflow using a potentiometer to simulate different wind conditions.

- 🛑 **Emergency Stop Lever**  
  A manual kill switch immediately stops the fan for safety during testing.

- 📺 **Live Session Feedback on LCD**  
  The LCD displays useful information such as session duration, fan speed level, and system status.

- 🌫️ **Smoke Generator**  
  For visualizing airflow over objects placed in the tunnel.

- 📱 **Optional Smartphone Mount**  
  A built-in holder allows you to record experiments directly from your phone for later analysis.


## 🧪 Use Cases  
- Aerodynamics experiments  
- Model testing (e.g., cars, airfoils)  
- Educational demonstrations
